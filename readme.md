## Development

1. Create a new folder in `packages/`, let's say `with-foo`.
2. See `package.json` in already existing packages and create new `with-foo/package.json`.
3. Put source code in `with-foo/src/`, it will be transpiled and bundled into `with-foo/dist/`, `with-foo/lib/` and `with-foo/es/`.
4. Put tests written with Jest in `with-foo/test/`.
5. Put demo in `with-foo/demo/`, it will be rendered and wrapped with HMR.

Available scripts using [Start](https://github.com/start-runner/start):

```
yarn start build <package>
yarn start demo <package>
yarn start test
yarn start testWatch
yarn start lint
```
